chirouter - A simple, testable IP router
========================================

The chirouter documentation is available at http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirouter/

*Note:
We passed every single test with the correct expected outputs according to the
Testing Your Implementation section of the project's specification when running
mininet on Hoang Phams' VM with chirouter running on either Hoang's CSIL 
Linux machine or VM (we also passed with mininet running on Hoang's VM and 
chirouter running on Tam Tran's CSIL Linux Machine).

However, we're getting inconsistent results when running mininet on Tam Tran's
VM and chirouter on Tam's CSIL Linux machine.
